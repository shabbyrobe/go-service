/*
Package servicetest contains tools and tests for the service package.

Please do not use any of the types exposed by this package.

To run the tests with code coverage, ensure you pass the packages to
'go test' like so:

	-coverpkg=github.com/shabbyrobe/go-service

Because there are so many pieces needed to test all this stuff, the files are
rather irritatingly named test_blahblah_test.go. Maybe it can be broken into
more packages so this isn't necessary but it'll do for now.
