- Tests for testing machinery. It's getting that way.
- Nice formatting for metafuzz insanity params
- Metafuzz parameters from an input argument
- Document usage patterns
- fuzzer runnerWithFailingStart chance
- unique incrementing id for every service start so you can tell if it actually happened.
- Atomic restartable services

- Fuzzer should count time service was running; could be evidence of failure if
  the average run time of a service does not match the bounds established by
  the randomised times.
