There's a defect I just can't pin down with StartWait and WhenReady and
OnServiceEnd if the service is configured to return an error instantly.

To reproduce, edit TestRunnerFuzzMessy like so:

    ServiceStartTime:  TimeRange{500 * time.Microsecond, 500 * time.Microsecond},
    StartWaitTimeout:  TimeRange{1, 1},
    ServiceRunTime:    TimeRange{0, 500 * time.Millisecond},

- service.WhenReady should take ctx so it can signal Done()
- service.ErrServiceEnded should be private and have an assertion method
- context.Context should be a first class citizen; this package seems to re-implement
  half of it just because I couldn't see past the janky API. I get it now, and this
  should use it.
