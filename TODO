There's a defect I just can't pin down with StartWait and WhenReady and
OnServiceEnd if the service is configured to return an error instantly.

To reproduce, edit TestRunnerFuzzMessy like so:

    ServiceStartTime:  TimeRange{500 * time.Microsecond, 500 * time.Microsecond},
    StartWaitTimeout:  TimeRange{1, 1},
    ServiceRunTime:    TimeRange{0, 500 * time.Millisecond},
